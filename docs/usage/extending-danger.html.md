Right now, we recommend extending Danger, and for sharing rules by creating your own `node_modules`. In the ruby version 
there is a lot of great infrastructure for plugins. We'd like to see this for Danger JavaScript too.

If you're interested in helping out there, everyone's notes are in [danger/danger-js#180][plugins].
