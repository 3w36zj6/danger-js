This ensures that Danger only runs when you have the environment variables set up to run.

### Can Danger comment inside a file on an PR?

Not yet, but there is a lot of discussion on [danger-js#77][77]

### I want to help influence Danger's direction

We'd recommend first becoming acquainted with the [VISION.md][] inside Danger, this is the long-term plan. Then there are two ways to start contributing today:

 * Opinions are extra welcome on issues marked as [Open For Discussion][open].
 
 * Well defined work items like features or fixes are marked as [You Can Do This][you-can-do-this].

We keep comments in the public domain, there is a Slack, but it's very rarely used. If you're interested in joining, you can DM [orta][].
